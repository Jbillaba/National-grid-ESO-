# slime tetris puyo-puyo
first project for General Assembly. 

- similar to tetris, puyo puyo is a tetris like game created in japan, 1991 
-originally released on msx2 
- the game had players grouping slimes of the same color together to make them disappear from the screen (similar to tetris) the goal was just to keep going until you lost (the screen gets full and you cant group any more slime together) 

- to make a group of slimes i would need to use oop in order to keep the code dry.
