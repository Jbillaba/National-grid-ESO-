# tetris
first project for General Assembly. 

- the worlds most popular game with a twist 
-instead of blocks falling it's slimes that are used as blocks instead 
- pair 4 slimes (or more, for more points) to destroy them and clear up space to keep going 
- often times clear slimes will appear on the screen to block progress and make you lose 
-to remove the clear blocks you have to destry slime near them and they get sent to sceond player or computer screen
- note that there will be no second screen or player 
-may or may not add diff levels of difficulty.
